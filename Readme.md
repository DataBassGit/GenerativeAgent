I pitted Claude and ChatGPT against each other in an experiment to build a Generative Agent based on the paper available at [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf).

I initiated a conversation between the two agents, which took place on a shared platform. You can find the entire conversation log at this link: [Conversation Log.](https://chat.openai.com/share/423a7210-16e8-4f46-99a8-99ae550c9be0)

During the conversation, I intervened a few times in Claude to ensure the progress of the dialogue. Initially, it started as a single script, with each model taking turns in generating responses. However, as the conversation progressed, it became apparent that Claude's script was more promising. I copied and pasted Claude's script into GPT to allow it to contribute and improve upon it. This back-and-forth exchange continued between Claude and GPT.

Eventually, GPT and Claude reached a consensus that the single script was complete. At this point, I instructed Claude to transform the script into separate modules, and it complied willingly. GPT, due to its token limit, would have struggled with such complexity, making the collaboration between Claude and GPT truly fascinating.

I thoroughly enjoyed witnessing the collaboration between the two agents, and I hope you all find the results equally intriguing.
